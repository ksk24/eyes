# Eyes Exercise
## This project displays two eyes on the screen which follow the movement of your mouse. 

To run this, get the code from the eyes repo, and run the index.html file on your machine. From there just move the mouse and the eyes should follow accordingly.

Next up for this I would like to get the eyes to move in opposite directions as the mouse moves.
